# Do-it-python-practice
 Learning daily use of python with the book 'do-it-python'



## 1. Return to Github and Programming

It's been 3 years since I committed myself to programming. I had to convert my energy to learn english to prepare for being an interpreting officer for my mandatory service. And still, despite all the time I've been away from programming, I believe my passion for langauge and interpretation (as in general terms, to interpret; to think and find logical ways to convey certain messages or intentions) has never been less. I hope, with my much improved English proficiency, I can successfully come back to the kingdom of codes and programs.



## 2. Study Plan

Honestly it's a bit embarrassing that I have to start all over again from the very beginning, after having taken a very intense 3-month course from 'multi campus' and a series of study with other language-major students during my university years. 

But what can I say? It's better to have a solid base than just following fancy curriculums that I don't even understand. What I can do is though that I can practice book faster than others, with a tiny bit of my previous experience.

So my plan is to proceed with at least 1~2 chapters a week, or more if possible. See what I can do!



## 3. What I use in this course...

All the codes and files that I use here belong to Aegis Publishing (이지스퍼블리싱) and the purpose of this repository is solely on practicing python. Those are programs and languages that I use:

- IDLE Python 3.8
- Notepad ++ 8.3.1
- Typora
